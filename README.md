# The-Hive Cortex Mimecast Responder

Hi! I created a mimecast responder to work with the-hive cortex . This responder uses mimecast api to block the url or domain that is inputed from the the-hive case.

## Example: Mimecast Responder Files

responders/Mimecast
|-- mimecast.json
|-- requirements.txt
`-- mimecastapi.py

## How to install

git clone https://github.com/kidshay/Mimecast.git

Copy Mimecast into Cortex-Analyzers/responders

Install the responder using pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## To-DO List

 - Build Report Template for The-Hive.
 - Fix typo in baseConfig should be Mimecast.
